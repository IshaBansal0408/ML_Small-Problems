## Machine Learning Challenges
### 1. Air Pollution Problem
        - Technology used : Linear Regression with multiple features

Air samples of different locations were taken and then five features of the air were extracted. Then the air quality index was calculated in the training data.

**Goal** : Design a machine learning model which can predict air quality index for testing data.

### 1. Air Pollution Problem
        - Technology used : K-Nearest Neighbor Classification

In this problem you are given a Diabetes Data set consisting of following features - ['Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'] The task is to predict whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not (Binary Classification)

**Goal** : Design a machine learning model which can classify a person as 0 or 1 (Diabetic or Not) using K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.
